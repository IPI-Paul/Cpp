After recent studies I have added the ability to call this script from the command line as well as being able to run it from RStudio. 
Use with quotes: "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.2\bin\x64\RScript.exe" "Path to this file\C++ multiplyBy.R" "Path to DLL File\multiplyBy x64.dll"
I have changed the function in RStudio to get you to select the DLL file first before running.
